I'm a graduate of Hunter College with a dual background in Computer Science and Clinical Psychology. Through my academic journey, I've developed a strong foundation in research methods and psychological theoryâ€”covering areas from child development to psychopathology and abnormal psychology.

On the tech side, Iâ€™ve built several full-stack web applications using React.js, Express, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and MongoDB. I also have experience in Python, in creating simple desktop programs to exploring data structures and solitions to numerous coding challenges. However, I would say my expertise is in C++, developing programs, software, and systems designs. I enjoy its core principles, always attempting to create immersive ideas with object oriented programming.

I have taken coursera courses in Cybersecurity, earning a Google cirtificate in cybersecurity. Additionally, Codepath's courses in IOS Development and Cybersecurity has given me expereince with Xcode, Swift, and has strengthened my understanding of cybersecurity principles.
